Answer :

1. First, Navigate to the required-plugins.php file located at plugin > woofers-developement-env > includes > admin > deactivate-plugins.php

2. You just Simply include the file path of the desired plugin in the array. So currently i have added some free plugin file path so check this screenshot URL, https://prnt.sc/pmpz9TYzd1ni

Currently i have no filepath for some Premium plugins so if you have, you can easily add it to the array in the same format as the free plugins. Follow the example structure in the screenshot provided, and insert the file path for the premium plugins.

Note : In the future, if you don't have a .dev site, you just need to add your domain name extension in the woofers-developement-env.php file. You can find this file at plugin > woofers-developement-env.php. Simply add your new domain name extension to the array. You can refer to this screenshot for assistance, https://prnt.sc/aYViqUWtV5p0
